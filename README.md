# Video-Game-Intervention
Got data from a data.gov, 'Data from: The influence of active video game play upon physical activity and screen-based activities in sedentary children' by Agricultural Research Service

Cleaned the data and then graphed how certain activities trended over the weeks. 
Conclusion was indecisive as sedentary and active screen time both trended in similar ways over the weeks.
There are around 16,000 entries and around 39% of the entries were 0
Given that the question asked was time spend doing x and y, I believe that there has to be major problems in how the questions were asked
Will try another dataframe as no real results could be derived from this
